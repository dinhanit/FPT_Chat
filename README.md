1. **EDA (Exploratory Data Analysis)**:
   - Collecting 
   - Familiarize with Data:
     + Understand the structure of the data: view format, number of rows and columns.
     + Check data types of each column.
     + View some initial records to understand the structure and content of the data.
   - Conduct data analysis to better understand your dataset.
   - Explore descriptive statistics, data distribution, and correlations between variables.

2. **Tokenizer**:
   - If working with text data, convert text into numerical representations (tokens).
   - Use a tokenizer to split sentences into words or words into tokens.

3. **Preprocessing**:
   - Handle missing, redundant, or noisy data.
   - Normalize data if necessary.
   - Convert data into the appropriate format for input into the model.


4. **Modeling**:
   - Build a suitable machine learning or deep learning model according to your goals.
   - Choose model architecture, layer configurations, and appropriate activation functions.
   - Design the neural network (if needed) and configure parameters.

5. **Validation**:
   - Split the dataset into training and validation sets.
   - Train the model on the training set and evaluate performance on the validation set.
   - Monitor model progress and determine when to stop training.

6. **Testing**:
   - Evaluate model performance on an independent test dataset that the model has not seen before.
   - Assess accuracy, reliability, and overall model performance.

7. **Optimized Hyperparameters**:
   - Fine-tune model hyperparameters to improve performance.
   - Use techniques such as grid search or random optimization to find the best values for hyperparameters.

8. **Testing (Again)**:
   - Test the model again after optimizing hyperparameters.

9. **Summary Achieved**:
   - Summarize the model: Architecture, Accuracy, Hyperparameters.

10. **Demo**:
   - Deploy a web application using Django:
     + Home: Provide information about the team, project, and contact details.
     + Applications: chat_PhoBert + Sentiment Classification..
